## Building With Maven

The build requires [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
v3.0.5+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) 19.0.0
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK, e.g.:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/tools/android-sdk
```

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

* Run `mvn clean install` from the root directory to run the integration tests, the formatter and to download all the dependencies.

Import the project to [IntelliJ 14](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as a maven project.

To run on desktop launch [MokapDesktop.java](https://github.com/e-ucm/ead/blob/3d79a4677c15ccd3896f7bc6624f6cc70e41f7fa/editor/mokap/desktop/src/main/java/es/eucm/ead/editor/MokapDesktop.java) from the `mokap-desktop` module as a Java Application. 
On Android you need to launch the `mokap-android` module as an Android Application.
