/**
 * Encapsulates an editor task which can be invoked from different contexts. 
 * For example, "undo", "redo", "save as", "open" and "run" will all be actions.
 * Notice that the some actions may require additional input from the user
 * before actually doing much; for instance, "save as" will likely pop up a 
 * dialog before saving anything.
 *
 * Actions are the only first line of interaction, exposing editor APIs to the 
 * GUI user. They delegate all the actual heavy lifting to the actual editor
 * APIs.
 *
 * Actions are instantiated by reading an "actions.json" file, which contains
 * a class-name, icon-url, shorcuts and UI locations for each action. 
 *
 * Action labels and descriptions are I18N dependant, and are initialized
 * at creation time by looking up key action.<i>name</i>.label and 
 * action.<i>name</i>.tooltip
