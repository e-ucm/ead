/**
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.editor.control.actions.AddScene} is a simple action that adds a scene to the current game.
 * It just creates a blank scene, with a generated new id (e.g. "scene0"), and puts it to the scenes map.
 *
 * The scene created has a blank {@link es.eucm.ead.schema.editor.components.Note} and its
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.schema.editor.actors.EditorScene#name} is set with the generated id (e.g. "scene0").
 *
 * It adjusts the {@link es.eucm.ead.schema.editor.game.EditorGame#editScene} field, to make this scene appear
 * on the edition view,
 *
 * It also updates the {@link es.eucm.ead.schema.editor.game.EditorGame#sceneorder} array, adding the new scene id
 * to the end.
 *
 * NOTE: This action does not save the scene file to disk. The actual scene file will not be created until the
 * user saves the game.
 *
 * Arguments and usage
 * This action does not require any argument. However, an optional boolean argument can be passed to indicate
 * whether the operation is undoable or not. This is intended for other actions that may want to invoke
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.editor.control.actions.AddScene} but which do not want the operation to be undoable since
 * it was not triggered by user interaction. For example, this is the case of
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.editor.control.actions.NewGame}, which creates a blank scene in the recently created game.
 * This operation cannot be undone since it does not make sense to revert the creation of new projects.
 *
 * This way, there are two recommended usage scenarios for this action:
 * 1) controller.action(AddScene.class)     This is the way that views should be using this action to create new
 * scenes. The operation will be undoable
 * 2) controller.action(AddScene.class, false)  This is the way that not-undoable actions should be creating new
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.editor.control.actions.AddScene} actions. It indicates that the add scene operation cannot
 * be undone, since the former action cannot be undone.
